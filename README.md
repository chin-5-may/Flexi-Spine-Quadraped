Quadruped Modeling with a Flexible Spine using MATLAB Simulink
This project focuses on the simulation and modeling of a quadruped robot with a flexible spine, inspired by biological locomotion. The goal is to create realistic motion patterns by incrementally improving the quadruped's mechanical model, starting with a simplified planar biped and progressing to a fully articulated quadruped with flexible torso and realistic leg dynamics.

Features:
Stage 1: Planar Biped Model using a simplified 2D sagittal plane representation. This stage reduces model complexity while introducing compliant leg behavior and torso flexibility.

Stage 2: Enhanced model with realistic leg movement, including knee joints and dynamic interaction with the ground to simulate energy efficiency and stability in cyclic motion.

Stage 3: Full quadruped model with a flexible spine, synchronized leg movement, and improved coordination between front and rear legs for realistic locomotion in complex environments.

Tools & Technologies:
MATLAB Simulink for modeling and simulation.

Simscape Multibody for mechanical component modeling.
